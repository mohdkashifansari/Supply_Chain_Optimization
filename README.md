# Supply Chain Optimization

## Project Overview

Supply Chain Optimization involves strategically planning and managing the procurement of materials necessary for manufacturing or assembling products. This process is crucial for companies to efficiently produce goods while minimizing costs and maximizing benefits from economies of scale. This project focuses on optimizing the supply chain for a body care products manufacturing company.

## Key Aspects

### What to Buy
- **Identify Components:** Determine the specific types of components required.
- **Quality Standards:** Ensure components meet the necessary specifications and quality standards.

### When to Buy
- **Lead Times:** Consider lead times, demand forecasts, and inventory levels.
- **Inventory Costs:** Avoid high inventory holding costs by not purchasing too early.
- **Production Delays:** Prevent production delays by not purchasing too late.

### At What Price
- **Supplier Negotiations:** Negotiate with suppliers to secure the best possible prices.
- **Bulk Purchasing:** Utilize bulk purchasing to benefit from volume discounts.
- **Strategic Partnerships:** Form strategic partnerships with key suppliers for better pricing and terms.

Supply Chain Optimization is a critical aspect of modern manufacturing and helps companies ensure that they have the right materials at the right time and price to meet production needs effectively.
